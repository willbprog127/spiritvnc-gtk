# spiritvnc-gtk
A GTK 3-based multi-connection VNC client for Unix-like and Windows systems 

This is a work in-progress so expect many changes and breakages.

This version of SpiritVNC is built using GTK 3 and the gtk-vnc widget.  Some features that the FLTK version has are not available here (gtk-vnc limitations and apparent bugs).  Don't ask me to release this on GTK 4 - GTK 4 is **pain**.  While this version seems to be relatively stable, be aware that these are early days so anything is possible...  

### Known issues ###
Clipboard ops are on-hold due to this bug: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-vnc/-/issues/35  There is also a gtk-vnc bug on Windows that prevents _any_ connection: https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/23948
